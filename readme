<B>Used the Natural Language API with Python to learn how to perform sentiment analysis, entity analysis, syntax analysis, and content classification.</B>

<B>Sentiment Analysis</B>

Performed Sentiment Analysis on a string and find out the Score and Magnitude using the Natural Language API.
The Score of the sentiment ranges between -1.0 (negative) and 1.0 (positive) and corresponds to the overall sentiment from the given information.
The Magnitude of the sentiment ranges from 0.0 to +infinity and indicates the overall strength of sentiment from the given information. 
The more information that is provided the higher the magnitude.

<B>Entity analysis</B>

Entity Analysis inspects the given information for entities by searching for proper nouns such as public figures, landmarks, etc., and returns information about those entities.

Syntactic Analysis extracts linguistic information, breaking up the given text into a series of sentences and tokens (generally, word boundaries), providing further analysis on those tokens.
This example will print out the number of sentences, tokens, and provide the part of speech for each token.
